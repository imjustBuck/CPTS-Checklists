# CPTS-Checklists
These are the checklists i used per phases of CPTS

These are what helped me stay on track and ensure I covered all the bases for the exam... even if i checked all the boxes and didnt find my answer, it helped by knowing we covered and took notes on everything in the checklist. these really helped me during times of mental fatigue or frustration and i hope these could help you on your path as well.
