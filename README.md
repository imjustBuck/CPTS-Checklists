# CPTS-Checklists
These are the checklists I used during each phase of my CPTS journey.

They’re copied directly from my Obsidian vault, so the formatting might look a little off here — but if you drop them into Obsidian, everything will look clean and you’ll be able to check items off as you go.

These checklists helped me stay focused, organized, and confident that I was covering all my bases — even when I hit dead ends. Just being able to say “I’ve already ruled that out” saved me tons of time and mental energy.

Whether you’re deep in the grind or just getting started, I hope these help you stay sharp and push through when things get frustrating.

Good luck on your path.
